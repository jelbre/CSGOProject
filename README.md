# CSGOProject

Counter Strike : Global Offensive is a popular online shooter. In this game you can get random skins for your weapons while playing. Due to some items being more rare to get and prettier to look at, these items began getting value for people, and people started trading, selling and even gambling their skins in the hope of getting better ones.

My application is based on the gambling aspect. In the client app, you can get items once in a while, which you can then trade to the Web app. Once you deposited your skin on the web app, you can create a coinflip for others to join. If another user inputs skins of aproximately the same amount, the coinflip will start and the winner will get the skins added to his inventory.

[Disclaimer: The skins in my project are all dummy objects and are not real steam items! The project is not meant to be released and used for gambling and were made solely for a school project]

This project was build around a year ago, and although I was quite proud of it back then, there are a lot of things that I now realise could have been done better, like not using relative file paths for background, importing server models on my client app, and a few more.

The part I am still kind of proud of is adding the possibility to authenticate yourself using your steam account with OpenID instead of using a username and password.
